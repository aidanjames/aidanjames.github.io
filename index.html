              Cameron (AKA Sven) is widely regarded as one of the most improved
              golfers in the world over the 12 months despite his ladies clubs,
              massive trolley, and many layers of mountaineer clothing. Pundits
              suggest he may end up with a handicap that he can't live up to and his recent elbow injury (real or perceived) is casting doubt over whether he has what it takes.
              Nevertheless, a strong favourite to take the spoils. Celebrated
              winner of the last "Olympic" Sandy crack major, held in Brighton
              in the summer of 2020.

            <p>
              Hattie is the only competitor in the field to never have won a
              Sandy Crack major (not even a "Commonwealth" eddition!), despite a
              couple of podium appearances. He hit a personal best score of 85
              in 2022 but you probably already knew that. He plays left handed
              although the evidence suggests he's got this wrong. An outside
              chance of winning due to his generous handicap, new fancy PING irons, and Saudi supporter's bag. Family commitments
              may hinder his chances. Also, the fact that he now lives no way near Merton raises questions over his eligibility.

              Pendlebury is a massive disappointment. Since winning the 2014
              Sandy Crack open ("Olympic" edition) he's been a consistent loser.
              Has not made a podium finish in as long as anyone can remember and
              recent form doesn't bode well. That said, more and more people are
              saying that he is due a prolonged run of good form and could be a
              dark horse to take out both the MGA tour and the Sandy Crack open
              in 2023. One to watch.
